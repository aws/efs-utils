\fBmount\&.efs\fR \- Mount helper for using Amazon EFS file systems\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR is part of the \fBamazon\-efs\-utils\fR \
package, which simplifies using EFS file systems\&.
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR is meant to be used through the \
\fBmount\fR(8) command for mounting EFS file systems\&.
.sp
\fIfs-id-or-dns-name\fR has to be of any of the following \
three forms:
.P
.IP \(bu
An EFS filesystem ID in the form of "fs\-abcd1234", generated \
when the file system is created\&.
.IP \(bu
A fully-qualified EFS DNS name in the form of \
"fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com"\&.
.IP \(bu
A domain name that has a resolvable DNS-CNAME record, \
which in turn points to a fully-qualified EFS DNS name \
in the form of "fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com"\&.
.P
\fImount-point\fR is the local directory \
on which the file system will be mounted\&.
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR automatically applies the following NFS options:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nfsvers=4\&.1
rsize=1048576
wsize=1048576
hard
timeo=600
retrans=2
noresvport
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
By default, when using the Amazon EFS mount helper with Transport \
Layer Security (TLS), the mount helper enforces the use of Online \
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and certificate hostname checking\&. \
These options can be configured in the config file located at \
\fI/etc/amazon/efs/efs\-utils\&.conf\&\fR.
.sp
Additionally, the Amazon EFS mount helper has built\-in logging for \
troubleshooting purposes\&. These logs are located at \fI/var/log/amazon/efs\fR\&.
.sp
It is possible to configure your Amazon EC2 instance to automatically \
remount your Amazon EFS file system when it reboots. For more information, \
see the online documentation at: \
\fIhttps://docs\&.aws\&.amazon\&.com/efs/latest/ug/mount\-fs\-auto\-mount\-onreboot\&.html\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-o\fR, Options are specified with a \fB\-o\fR flag followed by a \
comma separated string of options\&. All of the options specified in \
\fBnfs(5)\fR are available, in addition to the following EFS-specific \
options:
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.TP
\fBtls\fR
Mounts the EFS file system over TLS\&.
.TP
\fBtlsport=\fR\fIn\fR
Configure the TLS relay to listen on the specified port\&.
.TP
\fBverify=\fR\fIn\fR
Verify TLS certificates using the specified stunnel verify level\&. For \
more information, see \fBstunnel(8)\fR\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
sudo mount -t efs fs-abcd1234 /mnt/efs
Mount an EFS file system with file system ID "fs-abcd1234" at mount point \
"/mnt/efs" without encryption of data in transit\&.
.TP
sudo mount -t efs fs-abcd1234:/child /mnt/efs
Mount a non-root directory of an EFS file system with file system ID \
"fs-abcd1234" at mount point "/mnt/efs" without encryption of data in transit\&.
.TP
sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-abcd1234 /mnt/efs
Mount an EFS file system with file system ID "fs-abcd1234" at mount point \
"/mnt/efs" using encryption of data in transit\&.
.TP
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,verify=0 fs-abcd1234 /mnt/efs
Mount an EFS file system with file system ID "fs-abcd1234" at mount point \
"/mnt/efs" using encryption of data in transit and a verify level of 0\&.
.TP
sudo mount -t efs fs-abcd1234.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com /mnt/efs
Mount an EFS file system with the fully-qualified EFS DNS name \
"fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com" at mount point \
"/mnt/efs" without encryption of data in transit\&. If the region \
is correct, this is identical to mounting with just the file system ID\&.
.TP
sudo mount -t efs custom-cname.example.com /mnt/efs
Mount an EFS file system using the custom DNS name \
"custom-cname\&.example\&.com" \(em which has to \
resolve to a fully-qualified EFS DNS name such as \
"fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com" \
\(em at mount point "/mnt/efs" without encryption \
of data in transit\&.
