\fBmount\&.efs\fR \- Mount helper for using Amazon EFS file systems\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBmount\&.efs\fR \fIfs-id-or-dns-name\fR \fImount-point\fR [\fB\-o\fR \fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR is part of the \fBamazon\-efs\-utils\fR \
package. It improves mount performance and simplifies using EFS file systems\&.
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR is meant to be used through the \
\fBmount\fR(8) command for mounting EFS file systems\&.
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR launches a proxy process that forwards NFS traffic from the kernel's NFS client to EFS. \
This proxy is responsible for TLS encryption, and for providing improved throughput performance.
.sp
\fIfs-id-or-dns-name\fR has to be of one of the following \
two forms:
.P
.IP \(bu
An EFS filesystem ID in the form of "fs\-abcd1234", generated \
when the file system is created\&.
.IP \(bu
A domain name that has a resolvable DNS-CNAME record, \
which in turn points to a fully-qualified EFS DNS name \
in the form of "fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com" \
or "us\-east\-1a\&.fs\-abcd1234\&.efs\&.us-east-1\&.amazonaws\&.com"\&.
.P
\fImount-point\fR is the local directory \
on which the file system will be mounted\&.
.sp
\fBmount\&.efs\fR automatically applies the following NFS options:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nfsvers=4\&.1
rsize=1048576
wsize=1048576
hard
timeo=600
retrans=2
noresvport
tls (for Mac distributions)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
By default, when using the Amazon EFS mount helper with Transport \
Layer Security (TLS), the mount helper enforces the certificate hostname \
checking and disables the use of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). \
These options can be configured in the config file located at \
\fI/etc/amazon/efs/efs\-utils\&.conf\&\fR.
.sp
Additionally, the Amazon EFS mount helper has built\-in logging for \
troubleshooting purposes\&. These logs are located at \fI/var/log/amazon/efs\fR\&.
.sp
It is possible to configure your Amazon EC2 instance to automatically \
remount your Amazon EFS file system when it reboots. For more information, \
see the online documentation at: \
\fIhttps://docs\&.aws\&.amazon\&.com/efs/latest/ug/mount\-fs\-auto\-mount\-onreboot\&.html\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-o\fR, Options are specified with a \fB\-o\fR flag followed by a \
comma separated string of options\&. All of the options specified in \
\fBnfs(5)\fR are available, in addition to the following EFS-specific \
options:
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.TP
\fBtls\fR
Mounts the EFS file system over TLS\&. For EC2 instances using Mac distributions, \
this option is by default passed and the EFS file system is mounted over TLS\&.
.TP
\fBnotls\fR
Mounts the EFS file system without TLS, applies for Mac distributions only\&.
.TP
\fBtlsport=\fR\fIn\fR
Configures the proxy process to listen for connections from the NFS client on the specified port\&. This is applicable to both non-tls and tls mounts.
 By default, the \
tlsport is chosen randomly from port range defined in the config file located \
at \fI/etc/amazon/efs/efs\-utils\&.conf\&\fR.
.TP
\fBverify=\fR\fIn\fR
Verify TLS certificates using the specified stunnel verify level\&. For \
more information, see \fBstunnel(8)\fR\&.
.TP
\fBocsp / noocsp\fR
Selects whether to perform OCSP validation on TLS certificates\&, \
overriding /etc/amazon/efs/efs-utils.conf. By default OCSP is disabled. \
For more information, see \fBstunnel(8)\fR\&. \
The ocsp mount option is incompatible with the efs-proxy process, and will revert efs-utils \
to the legacy "stunnel" mode, which does not support improved per-client throughput performance.
.TP
\fBiam\fR
Use the system's IAM identity to authenticate with EFS. The mount helper will try \
to retrieve the required IAM credentials from the following locations: the aws credentials \
URI passed by mount option, the AWS CLI credentials file (~/.aws/credentials), and the
AWS CLI config file (~/.aws/config), the AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI
environment variable, the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, the EC2 instance profile\&.
The first location that has credentials will be used. This option requires the \fBtls\fR option\&.
.TP
\fBrolearn\fR
Role ARN for IAM authentication with AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API\&.
.TP
\fBjwtpath\fR
Identity token for IAM authentication with AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API\&.
.TP
\fBaccesspoint\fR
Mount the EFS file system using the specified access point. This option requires the \
\fBtls\fR option\&. The access point must be in the "available" state before it \
can be used to mount EFS\&.
.TP
\fBawsprofile\fR
Use the named profile used to lookup IAM credentials in the AWS CLI credentials file \
(~/.aws/credentials) or AWS CLI config file (~/.aws/config). If botocore is installed, \
assume the named profile and use the credentials of the assumed profile. If "awsprofile" \
is not specified, the "default" profile is used\&.
.TP
\fBawscredsuri\fR
Use the relative uri to lookup IAM credentials from ecs task metadata endpoint\&.
.TP
\fBcafile\fR
Use the cafile as the stunnel certificate authority file\&.
.TP
\fBnetns\fR
Mount the EFS file system to the specified network namespace\&.
.TP
\fBaz\fR
Mount the EFS file system to the specified availability zone mount target\&.
.TP
\fBmountport\fR
Use the port 2049 to bypass portmapper daemon on EC2 Mac instances running macOS Big Sur\&.
.TP
\fBmounttargetip\fR
Mount the EFS file system to the specified mount target ip address\&.
.TP
\fBstunnel\fR
Forward NFS traffic from the local NFS client to EFS using stunnel instead of efs-proxy.
This will enable compatibility with the ocsp mount option, but will not
deliver the increased throughput performance provided by efs-proxy. \
This option is enabled by default for Mac clients.
